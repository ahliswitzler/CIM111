<h1>Family Vacation </h1>
<p id="center"> My mom normally dictates where we go on our vacations. Since I was born,
I have gotten the opportunity to go to most of Europe, a little bit of the middle East,
and almost everywhere with moss or ice due to my mom's artistic pursuits in realism paintings (she basically
loves trees and the cold in her work). Other than that my family has also
found itself everywhere that my extended family has ended up; frequently
visiting the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in Oregon, or down in Texas with
my grandparents.  </p>
<br>
<br>

<h2> My first Vacation: Texas </h2>
<div class="main">
  <section class="page1">
    <img src="images/texas.jpg" width="100%">
  </section>
</div>

<h3> What I Remember: </h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> This photo was taken at my grandparents house in Houston, TX on Easter morning in 2003. </li>
    <li> I still believed in the Easter Bunny during this time and was waiting
    in this picture til he was done setting up our small easter egg hunt.  </li>
    <li> My grandparents got us these wierd wind up chicks that would peep
      while they walk, and I decided to give mine a bath. It wouldn't stop cheeping
      for a full twelve hour period cause the bolts holding the battery compartment
      were too tight to undo. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <br>

  <h2> Iceland </h2>
  <div class="main">
   <section class="page2">
     <img src="images/iceland.jpg" width="100%">
   </section>
   </div>

 <h3> What I Remember: </h3>
 <p>
    <ul>
  <li>This photo was taken when we were snow mobiling on the Vatnaj√∂kull Glacier.
   </li>
  <li> It was a two week trip where we slept in (probably) the scariest looking hotels ever
  due to how expensive everything was. </li>
  <li> My brother almost fell down a crevasse because I was little and tried to fake
  push him (only to end up actually pushing him)</li>
  <li> We read the last Harry Potter book every night as a family. </li>
  <li> The landscape (looking back now) was exactly like lord of the Rings,
    most incredible place I've ever gotten to go. </li>
    </ul>

</p>

<h2> Greece </h2>
<div class="main">
   <section class="page3">
     <img src="images/greece.jpg" width="100%">
   </section>
   </div>
   <h3> What I Remember: </h3>
  <p>
     <ul>
       <li> My dad was the most excited about this trip due to him being a world
       history teacher with an emphasis in Greek Mythology.  </li>
       <li> I was about 13 years old at this time and had just gotten my braces off
       and my dad in-order to encourage me to smile would always overdue it so I would too. (i.e. the
       weirdness captured in this photo) </li>
       <li> I ate lambchops (and I mean ONLY lambchops) for five days of this trip and got super sick. </li>
       <li> The Acropolis was my favorite thing I saw there so my grandparents and
       parents decided to give me an early birthday present by booking this really cool
      dinner with a view. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br>
<h2> France </h2>
<div class="main">
    <section class="page4">
      <img src="images/france.jpg" width="100%">
    </section>
    </div>
    <h3> What I Remember: </h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> We got to visit my mom's old art school in Paris as well as the dormatories
          she shared with my Aunt Diana when they were studying there. </li>
        <li> My mom took us to a bunch of the restaurants she used to go to when
          she was my age </li>
        <li> We were able to stay right on the Seine river close to Notre Dame
          for a night. </li>

        </p>

  <h2> Conclusion: My family's Vacations </h2>
  <div class="main">
      <section class="finalpage">
      <img src="images/vacation.jpg" width="100%">
      </section>
      </div>

  <p id="center"> I wasn't really sure what to do for this assignment but
    what I learned was how to basically use this plug-in and that though my family likes to
    stay in creepy hotels, push each-other into holes in the ice, and literally
    murder Easter toy chicks, we go to some cool places! Hope you like it!
              </p>
